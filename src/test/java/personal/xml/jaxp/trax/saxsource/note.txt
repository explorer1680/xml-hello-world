What is the purpose for the xaxsource?
In the test case basic, we can transformer the file, why we need this test?

Does JAXB uses SAX or DOM internally?

Note:
with or without:
XMLReader reader = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader(parserClass);

it still working.

Note: 
in SaxSourceWithXMLReaderTestRun, reader comes from
XMLReader reader = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();
everything works fine.

In SaxSourceWithParserReaderTestRun, reader comes from
XMLReader reader = parser.getXMLReader();
when transform without xsl:
Transformer transformer = factory.newTransformer();
it works fine.
when transform with xsl:
Transformer transformer = factory.newTransformer(xsl);
it don't work.
