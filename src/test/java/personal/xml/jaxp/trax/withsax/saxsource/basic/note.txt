What is the purpose for the saxsource?
In the test case basic, we can transformer the file, why we need this test?


This test case show that SAX also can be the source of transformer.
Normally, we think of SAX as a tool to parse XML, just like StAX, but they are different.
SAX is a kind of source of XML, it send out event, you define handler, you get the result you want,
if you don't define handler, it is still a XML source, the event come out by themselves, not by you.
StAX is different, it is not a source of XML, it is just a tool to parse xml, if you don't define cursor, it will not do anything.

Why we need XMLReader in SaxSource?
We can get SaxSource from inputStream directly, like in SaxSourceBasicTestRun.
Maybe, we can do some other job when transform the xml.
but, setup handler and get handler run is coming from separate code.
Here is the answer.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/transform/sax/SAXSource.html#SAXSource()
Note:
The Transformer or SAXTransformerFactory will set itself to be the reader's ContentHandler, and then will call reader.parse(inputSource).

Does JAXB uses SAX or DOM internally?

Note: 
in SaxSourceWithXMLReaderTestRun, reader comes from
XMLReader reader = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();
everything works fine.

In SaxSourceWithParserReaderTestRun, reader comes from
XMLReader reader = parser.getXMLReader();
when transform without xsl:
Transformer transformer = factory.newTransformer();
it works fine.
when transform with xsl:
Transformer transformer = factory.newTransformer(xsl);
it don't work.

It means the XMLReader do involve in the transform.
