Note 1:
The root element in po.xml has to be named "purchaseOrder", other names like "purchaseOrder1" not working.
if you want it work, you have to change followings:
1. @XmlType(name = "PurchaseOrderType" ...) in PurchaseOrderType (not needed)
2. private final static QName _PurchaseOrder_QNAME = new QName("", "purchaseOrder");  in ObjectFactory, (not needed)
3. @XmlElementDecl(namespace = "", name = "purchaseOrder1")  in ObjectFactory, (yes, you need to change here)


Note 2:
There are many element defined in po.xml, and there are corresponding java element representation in ObjectFactory class,
any of them can be passed to unmarshaller, and return a corresponding java object.

Note 3:
The class from this example are coming from xjc command, there are no @XmlRootElement on it,
so, you can't cast the ummarshalled object to PurchaseOrderType.
