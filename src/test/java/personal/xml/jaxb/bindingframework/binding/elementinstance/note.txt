Note 1:
The root element in po.xml has to be named "purchaseOrder", other names like "purchaseOrder1" not working.


Note 2:
There are many element defined in po.xml, and there are corresponding java element representation in objectFactory class,
any of them can be passed to unmarshaller, and return a corresponding java object.

Note 3:
The class from this example are coming from xjc command, there are no @XmlRootElement on it,
so, you can't cast the ummarshalled object to PurchaseOrderType.
