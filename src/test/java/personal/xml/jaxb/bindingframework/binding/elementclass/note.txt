this test case from elementclass.xsd, it has <jxb:globalBindings generateElementClass="true"/>
the default way is element instance.

Note 1: compared with "compared" package,

one more class is added:

public class Complex extends JAXBElement<AComplexType>

please note, it seems not too much difference, the element instance are returning
JAXBElement<AComplexType>

Note 2:
the class for this test case are also coming from xjc command,
compared with elementinstance, the unmarshalled object can be cast to Complex.

Note 3:
compared with the class annotated with @XmlRootElement, the Complex class's structure is different, it is a JAXBElement<AComplexTpye>


Note 4:
Compared with the example in jaxbcontext.schemaderived.objectfactory, the new created "Complex" object is ready to passed to marshaller.

Note 5:
Note how to create a new Complex object.
