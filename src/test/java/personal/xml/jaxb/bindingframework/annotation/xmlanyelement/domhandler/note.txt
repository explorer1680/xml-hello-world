in Root.class, there are 2 type of field,
1. Class defined by @XmlRootElement or ObjectFactory.
2. Object annotated with @XmlAnyElement
When unmarshaller xml,
1. it will try to use Class defined by @XmlRootElement or ObjectFactory.
2. then it will try to use @XmlAnyElement mechanism.

no @XmlAnyElement,  @XmlAnyElement on Object, @XmlAnyElement on Object list
In this test case, you unmarshaller xml file, and marshaller Root.
If you don't define @XmlAnyElement, you will lost the undefined xml element.
if the @XmlAnyElement define an Object, then only the last part keeps in Root.
If the @XmlAnyElement define an Object list, then all of the part keeps in Root.
If you just define @XmlAnyElement but don't define any thing like (lax=true, value="..."), the unmarshaller and marshaller still working.

lax=true or not
the default value for lax is false. In this case, the unmarshaller will return com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.ElementNSImpl for all xml element it find, whether it has definition or not.
if the lax=true:
for element defined with @XmlRootElement, it will return that class.
for element defined with ObjectFactory, it will return javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement.
for element undefined, it will return com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.ElementNSImpl.

value=handler or not.
If you don't define handler, it is ok, when you unmarshaller and marshaller the xml file, you don't lose anything.
handler is to do something for the com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.ElementNSImpl object passed to it.
that means, when you have lax=true, only undefined xml element pass to it.
when you have lax=false, all of the xml element pass to it.



In this test case, include jaxb.properties into the package or not will have different result.
If you include this file, it will using MOXy's implementation, and the "marshal" method inside of the DomHandler is be called.
If you don't include it, it will using the builtin implementation, and the "marshal" method inside the DomHandler will not been called.
(but, in current test case, when you using MOXy, it will have errors
because in method:
public E getElement(DOMResult rt) {...}
it has error, you can comment out some line in this method.
)

Note 1:
If A.class in not in JAXBContext.newInstance(), the element "a" will be:
personal.xml.jaxb.bindingframework.annotation.xmlanyelement.domhandler.E
because, in Root.class, you don't include A.class, so, if you don't include it in JAXBContext.newInstance(),
it is dom.ElementNSImpl then pass to CHandler, then getElement method return domhandler.E

Even B.class and ObjectFactory.class is not in JAXBContext.newInstance(), the element "b" is always a JAXBElement.

Note 2:
The interface "DomHandler" is generic.

Note 3:
If you have value="CHandler", this handler will deal with all element that belong to dom.ElementNSImpl
that's why it called DomHandler.

If you don't have value="CHandler", the default returned object will be:
com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.ElementNSImpl
If you have defined value="CHandler", the returned object will comes from method:
String getElement(StreamResult rt)

https://www.w3schools.com/xml/el_any.asp
where lax comes from, the default value is false.

Note 4:
It seems that in builtin implementation, if you want to let the handler do the unmarshal, you don't have any problem.
But, if you want to let the hander do the marshal,
the object returned from "Type getElement(StreamResult rt)" must have @XmlRootElement annotation.

Note 5:
you can think of (lax=true) try to find out the correct type if it is JAXBElement or your definition, the other type is dom.ElementNSImpl.
and value="CHandler" deal with dom.ElementNSImpl.

Note 6: if you define like:
@XmlAnyElement(StringHandler.class)
then, all the element go to this StringHandler even if you have already defined JAXBEelement and RootElement.
that is because you use the default value "false" to lax.



Note 7:
how to output '<' instead of &lt;
the reason why you get '&lt;' is because that in the unmarshal step, the dom.ElementNSImpl object has been converted by DomHandler.
Here, is the E.class, and the xml content of the dom.ElementNSImpl convert to String, and, when output string in marshal method,
it by default using '&lt;' for '<'. Using CharacterEscapeHandler to change this behavior.

Note 8:
Please note, in default implementation, even the marshal method is called, the "marshal" method inside of the DomHandler is not called.
In this case, the whole element is String content, no structure is parse, that is why the "<" become "&lt;".
If you want to parse the structure of content, you should add jaxb.properties and use MOXy implementation.

Note 9:
If you define the DomHandler as:
 DomHandler<String, StreamResult> and using the builtin implementation,
 then, the marshal will fail because the first parameter is type String, even if it actually not go into the marshal method inside of the DomHandler.

Note 10:
when using @XmlAnyElement, the whole logic is: (when lax=true, and you define the handler)
When unmarshal, the xml is parsed, if the element is predefined by @XmlRoot or ObjectFactory, it is parse as normal JAXB @XmlRoot element.
If it is not defined, it will pass to handler's "Type getElement(DOMResult rt)" method, and return and object as a element,
normally, it is a String that corresponding to the input file.
When marshal,
if we using builtin implementation, the element corresponding to @XmlRoot or ObjectFactory will marshal normally,
but the element coming from handler will marshal directly, if that element is String or Double, it will have error coming out.

Note 11:
Please note, in the:
public class DOMResultHandler implements DomHandler<E, DOMResult> {
}
you can use DOMResult or JAXBResult, SAAJResult, SAXResult, StAXResult, StreamResult
