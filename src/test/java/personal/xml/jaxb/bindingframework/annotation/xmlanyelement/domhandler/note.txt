Note 1:
If A.class in not in JAXBContext.newInstance(), the element "a" will be a dom.ElementNSImpl.
Even B.class and ObjectFactory.class is not in JAXBContext.newInstance(), the element "b" is always a JAXBElement.

Note 2:
The interface "DomHandler" is generic.

Note 3:
If you don't have value="CHandler", the default returned object will be:
com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.ElementNSImpl
If you have defined value="CHandler", the returned object will comes from method:
String getElement(StreamResult rt)

Note 4:
It seems that if want to let the handler do the unmarshal and marshal,
the object returned from "String getElement(StreamResult rt)" must have @XmlRootElement annotation.

If you don't know to marshal it, it is ok to return any thing.
