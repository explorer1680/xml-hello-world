Note 1:
how the format different with/without @XmlElementWrapper(name="documents")

Note 2:
It seems that you put another layer between Configuration and Document may have same result as @XmlElementWrapper.

Note 3:
If you don't have @XmlRootElement(name ="doc2") on Document class, it don't complaint about the missing default constructor, if you have the @XmlRootElement on it, you get following error info:
personal.xml.jaxb.bindingframework.annotation.elementwrapper.Document does not have a no-arg default constructor.

Note 4:
The @XmlRootElement(name ="doc2") don't control the element name if the Document inside of Configuration.
It only control the element name if Document is a root element.
