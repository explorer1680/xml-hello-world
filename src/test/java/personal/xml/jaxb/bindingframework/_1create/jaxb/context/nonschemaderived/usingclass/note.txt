Note 1:
in Airplane, it seems that @XmlRootElement is same as @XmlType
Actually, you don't need any of them, nor @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD).

It seems that @XmlType is only used when the class is derived from schema.

Note 2:
If you using jaxb.index, you need only Flight class in that file.

Please note, in the TestRun,
if you using:
JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance("personal.xml.jaxb.bindingframework._1create.jaxb.context.nonschemaderived.usingclass");
it is an example of using index.

Note 3:
the @XmlAccessorType's default value is public field or public getter and setter.
I guess, for getter and setter are used when marshaller or unmarshaller, if you want to unmarshaller and then marshaller, you have to define public getter and setter same time.
