Note 1: the call back method don't belong to any interface or superclass.
I guess it is called by Unmarshaller.

Note 2: it is called just within the class.

Note 3: you can see the print out by the class is:
Employee{employeeId=1, name='Tomcat', address=null, salary=null}

if you want to have salary, you should change the order in employee.xml
