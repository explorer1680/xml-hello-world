Note 1:
For the Marshaller, the overloading method allow to output java object to file, dom tree etc.

Note 2:
For the marshal method, the first parameter is Object, but, it should be a javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement, determined by JAXBIntrospector.isElement() method
There exist two mechanisms to enable marshalling an instance that is not a JAXB element:
One method is to wrap the instance as the value of a javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement instance, and pass the wrapper element as the first parameter to a marshal method.
For java to schema binding, it is also possible to simply annotate the instance's class with the appropriate program annotation, @XmlElementRoot.
