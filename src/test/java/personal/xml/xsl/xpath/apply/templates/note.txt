<xsl:apply-templates>

The <xsl:apply-templates> element first selects a set of nodes using the expression specified in the select attribute.
If this attribute is left unspecified, all children of the current node are selected.
For each of the selected nodes, <xsl:apply-templates> directs the XSLT processor to find an appropriate <xsl:template> to apply.
Templates are tested for applicability by comparing the node to the XPath expression specified in the template's match attribute.
If more than one template satisfies the match pattern, the one appearing with the highest priority is chosen.
If several templates have the same priority, the last in the style sheet is chosen.

Note, 2 kind of tag:
<xsl:apply-templates select="title"/>
<xsl:template match="cd">

Please note:
<xsl:template match="/catalog/">
<xsl:template match="/catalog/*">
<xsl:template match="/catalog">
are different

<xsl:template match="/catalog/"> == <xsl:template match="/catalog/node()">
it seems that you can't using <xsl:template match="/catalog/"> in this example.
