the fop project has already included the xalan-java project, they both comes from Apache

xalan is a XSLT processor.
https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~trc/public/courses/Spring2007/week5/xalan-howto.html

example:
https://www.leveluplunch.com/java/tutorials/020-transform-xslt-xml-to-html-using-java-with-apache-xalan/

in this example, it looks as same as builtin processor.
actually, the builtin processor is:
com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl
it is also the xalan implementation.

xalan extension:
